<p class="sansserif">A little bit about myself. (This is the index file)
I'm currently 20 and a 4th year at the University of Toronto Mississauga.
I study bioinformatics and statistics, even though I'm only formally
enrolled in statistics with minors in biology and computer science.
I didn't want to pay the deregulated fees that come with entering the
bioinformatics program, so I optted for this route instead. Since
I'm still able to take all the required courses, it doesn't make any difference.
