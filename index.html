<p>A little bit about myself. I'm currently 20 and a 4th year at the University of 
Toronto Mississauga. I study bioinformatics and statistics, even though I'm only 
formally enrolled in statistics with minors in biology and computer science. I 
didn't want to pay the deregulated fees that come with entering the bioinformatics 
program, so I optted for this route instead. Since I'm still able to take all the 
required courses, it doesn't make any difference.
