	<p>This is the website changelog. I'll be keeping a log of changes everyday that 
	I work on the website.</p>

	<p><b>May 15 2017</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made HTML files using Notepad++ to test code in Chrome</li>
		<li>Designed the basics of the website. Navigation bar started with Home and 
		About. The About section resembles my resume because thats one of the main 
		purposes I created this website.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>May 16 2017</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Uploaded files to GitHub pages. This took longer than expected since it 
		was basically my first time using Github. Took me a bit to figure out how 
		everything was set up.</li>
		<li>Added a starry night background to the Home page</li>
		<li>Created this changelog</li>
		<li>Planning on keeping the About page without a background since it's 
		easier to read that way. Also since it's basically my resume, it should be 
		kept clean.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>May 17 2017</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Used the Bootstrap Navigation Bar and Collapse feature to redesign the 
		website. I must say, it looks a lot better with the collapsible panels.</li>
		<li>Added a link to my Software Design Project hosted on Dropbox.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>May 18 2017</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Didn't really know what else to put on this website. I wanted to keep 
		the website simple since it's for personal use. Also had no motivation as I 
		was trying to rank up in Overwatch, so I pretty much spent my whole day on 
		that. I did see some nice design ideas from Google though, so I'll be 
		devoting time to that tomorrow, although it shouldn't take long. 
		It'll just add a little asthetic to my About page.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>May 19 2017</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made a minigame for the Home page. That was my first time writing
		Javascript code. The syntax is kinda like Java so it was easy to adapt.
		Took me a while to figure out how and when to use and compare .value and 
		.innerHTML. Javascript has some nice features to display your output with
		the .getElementById("Your id here"). Found that to be pretty useful.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>May 20 2017</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Updated my Education tab to list all the courses I've taken. Boostrap
		grid system is pretty good.</li>
	</ul>
